# lightning_animation
creates a lightning animation

In the init.py you can input your screen width and height. The window of the animation will be half of the input.
The screen color and the lighting color can also be adjusted in init.py

In animation.py line 4 and 20 can be used to play a sound but it stalls the animation so it is commented out.

random_functions.py was inteded to output random numbers so that the lightning strike is different everytime.
It is not used because the random functionality was implemented in animations.py
